# ``$ ./iceberg generate <article-name>``

This command will generate a the post who's name was passed as argument. The input and output paths are set in the config file.
For example, running ``./iceberg generate hello-world`` would generate ``<article-name>/hello-world/hello-world.md``.

# ``$ ./iceberg generate --all``

This parameter replaces the article name parameter, and when run, it will run the generate function on all posts that are found in the post data directory.
*Any hooks that would usually be triggered during the process with the plain command will be triggered for every post: if 3 posts are generated, the hooks will be run 3 times*

# ``$ ./iceberg generate <article-name> --no-hook``

The ``--no-hook`` parameter is optional, and is placed after the article name (which can also be replaced by ``--all``). When added, any hooks that would usually be run will not be.

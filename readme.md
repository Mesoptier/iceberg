# Iceberg

Iceberg is a static file blogging platform, built around **Markdown**. It runs on PHP 5.3+, and unlike many other alternatives, it doesn't require any external libraries or dependencies. It's as simple download, run the script, and you've got yourself a static blog.

Iceberg is still in active development, so using at this time is not recommended and bugs are to be expected in all versions to come. Iceberg is being developed by **Cyril Mengin** (Twitter: [@cyrilmengin](http://twitter.com/cyrilmengin)).

Installing
----------

Installing Iceberg is very simple, as it doesn't require any specific libraries or extensions, other than the ones that are already installed. Git can be nice to have, but is not required. To install Iceberg, just do the following inside a terminal:

    $ cd /path/to/blog
    $ git clone git://github.com/cyrilmengin/iceberg.git
    $ mkdir output && mkdir output/articles

And, that's it! You should be able to go straight into blogging at this stage, but you might want to mess around with the settings to change the output / source directory first, as well as get a proper layout/ theme.

Getting Started
---------------

So, you've installed Iceberg. That wasn't too hard, but what now? Well, you'll want to create a new post of course!
To do this you will need to create a new directory in your data folder. Note that the directory's name will represent the URL of the post.

    $ cd _data
    $ mkdir this-is-my-new-post

Inside that, you'll want to create your markdown file, as well as an assets folder if you're going to be using images in your post. This can be done in any file browser or editor. Careful, as the name of your markdown file should be the same as the parent directory:

    $ cd this-is-my-new-post
    $ touch this-is-my-new-post.md
    $ mkdir assets

Okay, so that's all the files you'll need to create. If you're using images, stick them all inside the assets directory -- it will later be copied alongside your article. Now, last little bit before you can actually write your post, front-matter! This is just some information that should be placed at the top of the markdown file, in the following format:

    -----
    title: This is my new post!
    author: Cyril Mengin
    layout: post                    # Note this, it's the name of the template to be used
    -----

And that's it! You can now write your article underneath that. Once you've finished writing, you're ready to generate the static files. Navigate to the root directory of iceberg, and type this in the terminal:

    $ ./iceberg generate this-is-my-new-post
    
Your new article should now be awaiting you in the output dir!
